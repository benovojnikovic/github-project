                    <p>
                        The commits are able to craft history internationally safely, they are building blocks of “save point” within Git's version control. 
                        Over time, commits should tell a story of the history of your repository and how it came to be the way that it currently is. 
                        Commits include lots of metadata in addition to the contents and message, like the author, timestamp, and more. You can make commits to 
                        different branches, and specify exactly what changes you want to include. Before running a commit it's a great idea to run “git status” 
                        and when you stage new changes that you'll like to include “git add [file]”. The commits have two phases that help you craft commits properly. 
                        All commits should be logical, atomic units of change that represent a specific idea. The most related commands are: “git add [file]” “git status” 
                        “git push” “git log”. The git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire 
                        repository at specific times.
