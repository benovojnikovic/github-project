<ul>
    <li> The company, GitHub, was formed in 2007 by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon, and the GitHUb service was rolled out in February 2008.</li> 
    <li> 2009 – June 2013- GitHub continues to release products including GitHub Enterprise, Redcarpet, and Hubot. Many companies that now regularly use GitHub – including Facebook and Google – join GitHub during this period.</li>
     <li>July 2013 – September 2015- GitHub continues to launch a series of products and enhancements to existing products. For the desktop, it releases Electron, Atom, and a desktop client. 
    In terms of outreach, it launched the Bug Bounty Program, ChooseALicense.com, GitHub Classroom, GitHub Student Developer Pack, and the GitHub Engineering blog. 
    The GitHub website also experiences multiple attacks as well as censorship from governments. In April 2014, co-founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner resigned the company following allegations of harassment.</li>
     <li> October 2015 – present- GitHub changes its pricing model from a repository-based one to a user-based one; in the process, it introduces unlimited private repositories for paying customers.</li>
  </ul>
