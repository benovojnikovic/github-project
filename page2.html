    <h2>What Github offers</h2>
        <p>One of the key features that GitHub offers is "forking". It allows you  to copy another repository on the website, and 
            make changes within it. Keep in mind there are millions of repositories across the site. Meaning you are able to choose from any public repos, 
            make changes to it, and then request that the original owner merge or pull your changes into his original repository. This is what GitHub is all about. 
            People working together to help make changes in their code and software for the better. Before the creation of GitHub, users had to make changes to 
            repositories on their local machines, which was often not efficient.
